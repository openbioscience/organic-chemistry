# Comparing base strength qualitatively

## What we know
- Smaller pKa means stronger acid, which equivalently means a weaker
  base.

## What to remember

## Guide

We compare the strength of two acids by **comparing the stability of the
conjugate bases.**

Alternatively, we can compare the acidity of two protons within a single
molecule in the same way (compare the stability of the conjugate bases).

We compare the strength of two bases by seeing which is more stable: the more
stable base is the weaker one, since it does not want to accept protons (it is
happy with its current state). Alternatively, the more stable base has a
stronger conjugate acid, and we know the stronger the acid, the weaker the
conjugate base.

We look at the following factors when determining acid/base strength:

- Atom
- Resonance
- Inductive effects
- Orbitals
- Solvating effects

## Frequently asked questions
- How come a strong acid has a weak conjugate base, and weak acid also has a
  weak conjugate base (buffers)? Does any acid have a strong conjugate base?
  - when we say that a strong acid has a weak conjugate base (CB1), and a
    weak acid can also have a weak conjugate base (CB2), if we compare CB1 and
    CB2, CB2 will be a stronger base than CB1. That is to say, "weak base" covers
    a large range of bases, some of which are stronger than others.
  - An example of an acid with a strong conjugate base is **butane**: butane is
    such a weak acid that its conjugate base is very strong. That is to say,
    **not all weak acids have weak conjugate bases.**
